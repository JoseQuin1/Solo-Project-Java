PuppyShop
2 account profile types:
User & Breeder.
Breeders can add there inventory when logged in as a breeder.
User's can not. They only have favorites and account details. In order to have favorites, you must like a puppy.


Crud is found primarily in the Breeder profile "Catalog" page and some in the ContactUs page.
- One to many - Users/Dog/Message
- Many to many (like & unlike) on the puppy / favorites and puppy details page.


Notes:
The ask about me form on the puppy "details page" is a dummy from that was going to be apart of something else I didn't get time to add.
The file upload too - I had it working and something happened towards the time when I was going to hand in the project and didn't have time to fix it. ( booo )

That should be it.
